<p><span class="f_Heading1">Join a Channel</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have connected to an IRC Server, you can join a channel to talk to other people. There are several ways to join a channel. Each is explained below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">The Favorites Folder</span></p>
<p>The easiest way to join a channel is through the favorites folder where you can store a list of your favorite channels. mIRC <span class="f_Bolddefault">automatically</span> pops up this folder the moment you connect to an IRC Server. You can join one of the listed channels by selecting it and clicking the <span class="f_Bolddefault">Join</span> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also view the favorites folder by clicking on the favorites folder button in the toolbar or through the Tools menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">The Channels List</span></p>
<p>Another way to join a channel is to retrieve the list of currently active channels by using the <a href="channels_list.html">Channels List</a> dialog. To retrieve the channels list, you can click on the <span class="f_Bolddefault">Get List</span> button. The list can be quite long, often thousands of channels, so it can take several minutes to retrieve it. mIRC will save this list once you have retrieved it, so if you wish to view it again later you can just click on the <span class="f_Bolddefault">Apply</span> button. However, if you want an updated list you will need to retrieve it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you click your right mouse button in the channels list window, a popup menu with various options will appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">Note:</span> You can also specify a filename for the channels list which can be useful if you regularly visit different IRC networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">The /join Command</span></p>
<p>The format of the /join command, which is a <a href="basic_irc_commands.html">Basic IRC Command</a>, is <span class="f_Bolddefault">/join #channel</span> where #channel is the name of the channel you want to join. So if you wanted to join channel #mIRC, you would type <span class="f_Bolddefault">/join #mIRC</span> and press enter, and a moment later the #mIRC window will open indicating that you have joined it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">Creating a new channel</span></p>
<p>You can create a new channel if it does not already exist just by joining it. If you want to create a channel called #bubbles, you would just type <span class="f_Bolddefault">/join #bubbles.</span> If it does not exist it will be created for you. If it does exist, you will join it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">Talking on a channel</span></p>
<p>You can talk to other people by typing in a message and pressing the enter key. Your message will be sent to the channel and everyone on the channel will see it. A good first message is just to say hello to everyone with a smiley face :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <span class="f_Bolddefault">listbox</span> on the side of the channel window lists all of the people who are currently on that channel. If you click your right mouse button in the listbox, a popup menu with various options will appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">Popup menus</span> are actually used everywhere in mIRC, you can even click your right mouse button in the status window, or in the channel window itself, and a different popup menu will appear. These popup menus are configurable, you can change them in the <a href="popups.html">Popups</a> dialog to perform whatever functions you require.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Bolddefault">Leaving a channel</span></p>
<p>You can leave a channel by clicking the channel window close button, or you can use the <span class="f_Bolddefault">/part</span> command, which is another <a href="basic_irc_commands.html">Basic IRC command</a> similar to /join. The format of the /part command is <span class="f_Bolddefault">/part #channel</span> where #channel is the name of the channel you want to leave. If you type <span class="f_Bolddefault">/part</span> without a channel name and press enter, you will part the current channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">Hint:</span> you can click the top left corner button/icon in any window in mIRC to view the <a href="system_menu.html">System</a> menu which contains useful features.</p>
