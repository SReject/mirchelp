<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as being able to chat on public <span class="f_Bolddefault">channels</span>, mIRC also allows you to chat <span class="f_Bolddefault">privately</span> with other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are <span class="f_Bolddefault">on a channel</span>, and you see someone you would like to chat with, you can <span class="f_Bolddefault">double-click</span> on their nickname in the nickname listbox and a private query window will open up. You can then start chatting privately to them through the query window. Alternatively, you can <span class="f_Bolddefault">click your right mouse button</span> on a nickname in the nickname listbox and a <span class="f_Bolddefault">popup menu</span> will appear with various options, one of which will be to open a private query window to the selected nickname.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are <span class="f_Bolddefault">not on a channel</span>, you can type the command <span class="f_Bolddefault">/query nickname</span>, where nickname is the person you want to chat with. Press the enter key, and a query window will open up and you can start chatting privately, assuming of course that the person is on IRC. You can <span class="f_Bolddefault">find out</span> if a person is on IRC by using the <span class="f_Bolddefault">/whois nickname</span> command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another way to chat privately called <span class="f_Bolddefault">DCC Chat</span>. This method is more secure and usually faster because it does not rely on the IRC Server to relay your messages. Instead it connects <span class="f_Bolddefault">directly</span> to the other IRC Client. However it does need to use the IRC Server to <span class="f_Bolddefault">initiate</span> the chat session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To DCC Chat with someone, click on the <span class="f_Bolddefault">Chat button</span> in the toolbar, and a DCC Chat dialog will pop up. Enter their nickname, and click on the Chat button, and if they <span class="f_Bolddefault">accept</span> your DCC Chat request, you will be able to start talking to them in private.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone sends <span class="f_Bolddefault">you</span> a chat request, a chat dialog will pop up asking you whether you want to accept their chat request. You can then accept or decline. You can find out more about DCC Chat related settings in the <a href="dcc.html">DCC</a> section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="cmd_dccchat"></a>The <span class="f_Bolddefault">/dcc chat &lt;nickname&gt;</span> command is another way of initiating a dcc chat, where nickname is the user you with whom want to dcc chat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="f_Highlight">Note:</span> DCC Chat needs to use your IP address to initiate a connection with another client. If you are having trouble initiating a connection then your IP address might be wrong. See the <a href="local.html">Local</a> section for more information.</p>
