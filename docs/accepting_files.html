<p><span class="f_Heading1">Accepting Files on IRC and the Internet in General</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharing files on IRC is part of what makes IRC fun, however it is important to be <span class="f_Bolddefault">careful</span> about <span class="f_Bolddefault">who</span> you accept files from and <span class="f_Bolddefault">which</span> types of files you accept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although <span class="f_Bolddefault">most</span> files are safe, there are always a few that may be infected with a virus, or may be malicious programs that try to damage your computer. Since it is impossible to know in advance whether a file that is being sent to you might cause a problem, following a few common sense rules can help:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Install anti-virus and firewall software and make sure that they are always up-to-date. They should &nbsp;automatically scan any files that you download. However please note that since IRC is a highly interactive medium where information spreads very quickly, using anti-virus software does not guarantee that a file will be safe, as it takes time for anti-virus and firewall software to be updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Only accept files from people that you know and trust. You should <span class="f_Bolddefault">never</span> accept files from people you do not know and <span class="f_Bolddefault">never</span> accept files without knowing what their purpose is, even from someone you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Files ending in .BAT, .COM, .EXE, .DLL have the most potential to cause problems. You should <span class="f_Bolddefault">not</span> accept such files from people you do not know or download them from sites that do not appear trustworthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Aliases, Popups, or Scripts that can be <span class="f_Bolddefault">loaded</span> or <span class="f_Bolddefault">typed</span> into your IRC client can also cause problems. mIRC, and most other IRC clients, allow you to create scripts that perform <span class="f_Bolddefault">useful</span> functions but these can also cause problems if misused. You should make sure that you know and trust the source of these files before using them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Certain types of Document files can contain <span class="f_Bolddefault">macros</span> which are run by your Word Processor when you open the document to view it, so these are also potentially harmful. You should make sure that you have macro-warnings turned on in your Word Processor. It is also safer to view any documents that you receive in a plain-text editor first if possible.</p>
