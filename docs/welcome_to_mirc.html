<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mIRC is a full featured <span class="f_Bolddefault">Internet Relay Chat</span> client for Windows that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group conferences or in one-to-one private discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has a <span class="f_Bolddefault">clean, practical interface</span> that is highly configurable and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers, multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support, UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray notifications, message logging and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mIRC also has a <span class="f_Bolddefault">powerful scripting language</span> that can be used both to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide range of functions from network communications to playing games. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are new to mIRC, the first few sections of the mIRC help file will introduce you to the basic features of mIRC and IRC. They will also guide you through the first few steps of <a href="connect_to_a_server.html">Connecting</a> to a server, <a href="join_a_channel.html">Joining</a> a channel, and Chatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have learned how to use the basic features of mIRC and IRC, you can move on to the more complex features, such as configuring mIRC for your own needs or learning how to create scripts and popups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
